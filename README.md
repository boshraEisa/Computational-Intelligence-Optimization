Comparing the accuracy scores between an optimized random forest classifier with a genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Which optimization algorithm will generated the highest accuracy?  


One application of artificial intelligence in the medical field is diagnosis prediction using machine learning algorithms. Due to the high sensitivity and the importance of precision in the medical field, those predictive models must be highly accurate. In this paper, two optimization algorithms, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, has been employed to increase the accuracy score of a machine learning predictive model by implementing feature selection technique. The results of the two optimization algorithms have been compared and it was revealed that genetic algorithm performed better with an accuracy score of 0.99813, compared to particle swarm optimization that generated a 0.97667 score.
